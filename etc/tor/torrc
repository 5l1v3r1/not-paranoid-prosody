HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/xmpp/  
HiddenServicePort 5222 127.0.0.1:5222

# Uncomment the next 3 lines if you want to set up SSH as an authenticated hidden service:
 
#HiddenServiceDir /var/lib/tor/ssh/
#HiddenServicePort 22 127.0.0.1:22  
#HiddenServiceAuthorizeClient stealth ssh

# If you do this, you will only be able to use your SSH onion address if you add the
# HidServAuth option to the torrc file on your local machine. You need to run this  
# command after uncommenting the above lines and reloading tor:

# cat /var/lib/tor/ssh/hostname

# Your output will look something like this:

# 'examplexxxxxxxxx.onion 0nFkc5iGHR1DR7ijcbHgZL # client: ssh'

# Take that output and open up the torrc on your local machine in a text
# editor. Add this to the end of your torrc:   

# HidServAuth examplexxxxxxxxx.onion 0nFkc5iGHR1DR7ijcbHgZL

# For extra Zen points, bind SSH to 127.0.0.1 and restart it after you've confirmed
# that your authenticated hidden service works.
